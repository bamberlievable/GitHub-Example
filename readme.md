# learning git
This repo is to learn and practice **git and github**


## what is git? 
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the different versions of it  

## what is commit?
Acts as a checkpoint for our projects. It's a snapshot of our project during the point in time. We can use **commits** to rollback changes to that point. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our project's history. 

## what is push? 
Pushing allows us to ove any new commits to a remote repository. So in this case we can push our commits to github.

## what are branches? 
Branches are different versiosn of our repo created from a commit. They allow us to work on different versiosn of our project simultaneously with others and keep our work independent. Master/Main branch is ususally the default branch with the most changes.

## What is merging? 
Merging is taking the code from one branch and merging it to another. Ususally, we'll have feature branches that branched off the Main branch and we'll merge once the feature is complete.
