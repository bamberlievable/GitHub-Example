# learning git
This repo is to learn and practice **git and github**


## what is git? 
Git is a version control system, we utilize it to maintain the history of our projects as well as the different versions of it  

## what is commit?
Acts as a checkpoint for our projects. It's a snapshot of our project during the point in time. We can use **commits** to rollback changes to that point. **Commits** are how we are keeping track of our project's history. 

## what is push? 
Pushing allows us to ove any new commits to a remote repository. So in this case we can push our commits to github.
